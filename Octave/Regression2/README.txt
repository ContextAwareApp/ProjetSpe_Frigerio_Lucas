This file contains Octave code and Data

- logisticReg.m is the "main" and should be executed in octave (simply type logisticReg)
- fmincg.m : optimisation function (uses gradient descent)
- lrCostFunction.m : compute the cost and the gradient
- oneVsAll.m : uses other functions to determine optimal parameters.
- predictOneVsAll.m : uses learned parameters to predict the class of an example.


- data_sRun : learning set for running (still incomplete : too little data, non summarized version)
- data_sStill : learning set for still (standing, fidgeting lightly) (still incomplete : too little data, non summarized version)
- data_sWalk : same (walking)
- data_sumRun : summarized data for running
- data_sumWalk : summarized data for walking
- data_sumStill : summarized data for being still

test.txt : data recorded by M Alphand during the presentation.
